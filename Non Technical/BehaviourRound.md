### **3. Tell me about a challenging project and how you overcame obstacles?**

In my current role at Intimetec, I worked on optimizing the frontend of a Manufacturing Management System (MMS). One of the biggest challenges was dealing with a legacy codebase that had performance issues and lacked modularity. The application had long load times and was difficult to maintain due to tightly coupled components.

To overcome this, I led the refactoring of key React components, breaking them into reusable and smaller units. I also applied performance optimization techniques like memoization and lazy loading. Collaborating with a team of 15+ developers, we aligned our changes with the client’s expectations and delivered a smoother, more responsive UI.

These improvements resulted in faster load times and a better user experience, and it also made future development more manageable. This project really tested my problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of clean, scalable React architecture.
Based on your resume, here's how you can answer these behavioral interview questions with specific, personalized examples that reflect your experience:

---

### **4. How do you handle tight deadlines and pressure?**

"In my current role at Intimetec, I’ve often worked under tight timelines, especially when delivering Proofs of Concept (POCs) to clients. I prioritize tasks by breaking down large features into smaller, manageable components, which helps in maintaining focus and progress. For example, when we had to deliver a client-facing feature for the Manufacturing Management System (MMS), I coordinated with backend developers to parallelize work. Despite time constraints, I ensured thorough testing and code quality, leading to a smooth and on-time release."

---

### **5. How do you handle feedback and criticism?**

"I welcome feedback as a way to improve my work. During a code review for a React component I wrote while refactoring a legacy feature, a senior developer suggested improvements in performance and structure. Instead of taking it negatively, I studied best practices for React component optimization, applied them, and improved the component's performance. Later, I shared those learnings with the team, which helped in standardizing our approach to component design."

---

### **6. How do you ensure effective collaboration with cross-functional teams?**

"Working in a team of over 15 developers at Intimetec, I regularly collaborate with backend engineers, testers, and designers. I ensure clear communication through daily stand-ups, shared documentation, and regular check-ins. One instance was during the development of the recommendation engine feature—we needed frequent alignment with the data team to ensure the UI accurately reflected the personalized meal suggestions. Effective collaboration made the feature successful and user-friendly."

---

### **7. How do you stay updated with the latest frontend technologies?**

"I’m passionate about frontend development and dedicate time to stay current. I follow blogs, explore documentation, and apply new learnings in personal projects. For example, I implemented modern React practices such as hooks, lazy loading, and memoization in my Netflix and YouTube clone projects. I also explore real-time features, as seen in my DevTinder project, where I integrated live chat functionality using MERN stack technologies."

---

### **8. Can you describe a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly?**

"At Intimetec, I was once tasked with maintaining a feature that involved ColdFusion—a technology I wasn’t familiar with. I quickly got up to speed by studying the documentation, reading existing code, and reaching out to experienced colleagues. Within a few days, I was able to identify issues and contribute fixes effectively. This experience reinforced my ability to adapt and learn fast, even with unfamiliar tech stacks."

### **9. How do you ensure the accessibility and responsiveness of your web applications?**

I adhere to best practices by using semantic HTML, ensuring keyboard navigability, and testing with screen readers to enhance accessibility. For responsiveness, I utilize CSS Flexbox and Grid, and conduct testing across various devices and screen sizes. In our Manufacturing Management System, these practices have been crucial in providing a seamless experience for all users, including those on the factory floor using tablets or mobile devices.

### **10. What motivates you in your work?**

The opportunity to create user-centric applications that solve real-world problems motivates me. Knowing that my work contributes to the efficiency of manufacturing processes and, potentially, to the betterment of healthcare services, gives me a sense of purpose. I find fulfillment in continuous learning and in the tangible impact of the solutions I develop.
