### **1. Introduce Yourself ?**

Hi XXX , I'm Kaushik. I am working as a Software Engineer at Intimetec for the past 2.5 years. Currently, I’m working as a frontend developer. My tech stack includes React.js, JS and SQL. I also have a basic understanding of Node.js and Express.js.

In my current project which is Simplot MMS, although my primary role is frontend, I occasionally handle minor backend tasks when needed. For the past 1.5 years, I’ve been working on Simplot MMS project. Simplot basically takes raw potatoes from farms and processes them in its factories. The potatoes go through several stages like cleaning, blanching, cutting, and packaging. My role is to develop components, pages, and features for the application.
